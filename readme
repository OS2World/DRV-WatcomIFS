These files show how to build an IFS (Installable File System)
driver using Open Watcom 1.3 for OS/2

Thanks to Open Watcom team, they included support for developing
16-bit OS/2 modules, for which an IFS driver is required to be
produce as. Prior to Open Watcom, the way to create an IFS driver
was to use the DDK with Microsoft 6.0 compiler for OS/2.

Also included is an INF document explaining IFS development.

A good example for IFS development is to look at the FAT32 IFS
driver.

Happy IFS Development!
